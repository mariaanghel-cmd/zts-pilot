    <b>Instructions</b>
    <p>
        The upcoming trading task will be conducted using a browser-based trading interface (see the image below for an illustration). 
        The task consists of 11 rounds: 1 practice and 10 main round.
        <!--Your combined performance in the two main rounds determines your compensation. -->
        <br>
        <br>
        At the beginning of each round you will be endowed with an initial portfolio consisting of a safe asset, Cash, 
        worth 10 000 currency units. You can use this Cash to trade a risky asset, Shares. 
        In each round, you can buy or sell Shares by clicking ”Buy” or “Sell” buttons of the corresponding size. Shares are characterized by higher volatility than Cash.
        <br>
        <br>
        The prices are historical daily closing prices of real-world companies from the stock exchange.
        Any trade that you make will be executed instantly at the current market price. You can buy or sell as many shares as you want, 
        under the condition that you have sufficient funds for the transaction.
        <br>
        <br>
        The y-axis of the price chart adjusts automatically to the 
        current market price. These changes only reflect the current price, and are not informative for future price changes.
        <br>
        <br>
        You might see some news displayed underneath the ”Buy” or “Sell” buttons. 
        If no news appears, do not worry, make your trading decisions based on the price information given.
